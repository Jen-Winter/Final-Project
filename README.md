# Ironhack Final Project ‚Äî Upcabulary ‚úçÔ∏èüìò

This is my final project for the Ironhack Frontend Development Bootcamp. **Upcabulary** is a responsive vocabulary learning app that empowers users to add, edit, and track the mastery of new words.

Built with **Javascript**, **Vue 3**, **Pinia**, and **Supabase**, and deployed on **Netlify**, this project demonstrates my ability to create a modern, full-featured Single Page Application (SPA) with authentication, persistent data, and a polished user experience. The 4 basic operations of persisent data bases were implemented on the User's dashboard: CRUD (Create, read, update and delete), allowing full data flexibility. 

> ‚è±Ô∏è Over 45+ hours were spent designing, building, and refining the app.

## üìÑ Final Notes
This project was a comprehensive exercise in combining the main frontend skills I gained at Ironhack. From authentication and state management to UX and deployment, Upcabulary challenged me to think like a real developer. I'm proud of how it turned out so far in those few hours of work ‚Äî and there's more I'd love to add in the future!
